Hello there,

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am Parsa, a computer science major with a strong interest in AI, machine learning, and web development.

Currently, I am working on a web application using React.js to enhance my front-end development skills and create exceptional user experiences.

I am passionate about exploring the potential of machine learning and AI and actively seeking projects that challenge and expand my knowledge in these transformative technologies.

Graduating in 2024, I am eager to secure internship or full-time positions for new grads, where I can apply my expertise, learn from experienced professionals, and contribute to innovative projects.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see my projects. I am open to collaboration and look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals who share a passion for technology.

Let's embrace the dynamic world of technology together!
